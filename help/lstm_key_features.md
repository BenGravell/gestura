1. **Memory Cell**: At its core, the LSTM maintains a cell state, as well as an output, across the sequences.

2. **Gates**: LSTMs introduce gates that regulate the flow of information.

    - Forget Gate: Decides what information to discard from the cell state.
    - Input Gate: Updates the cell state with new information.
    - Output Gate: Determines the value to output based on the cell state and the input.

3. **Avoidance of Long-Term Dependency Problem**: The unique structure of LSTMs helps in retaining long-term dependencies in the data, making them highly effective for many sequential tasks.
